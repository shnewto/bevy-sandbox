# bevy-sandbox
sandbox for working on bevy things out in the open

## save-load

in this `save-load` branch, there are some boiled down versions of things I'm doing with [moonshine_save](https://github.com/Zeenobit/moonshine_save) to load saved geometry data
- this sandbox version is pretty lo-fi, so to experiment with either of the two paths, 
create geometry + save it, or load geometry data from file + spawn it, you'll need to comment / uncomment the annotated `add_systems` code

what I expect the app to look like when running
